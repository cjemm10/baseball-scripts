This is a repository where I keep all of my baseball scripts that I have been working on as personal projects.

Fangraphs Scraper - Script that stores batter and pitcher data from 2010 -present. Every time I run it, I scrape the current seasons data and append it to a dataframe holding all years prior. This helps reduce run time so that I am only retrieving dynamic data, as opposed to static data from past years.

MLB API - Still working on.
