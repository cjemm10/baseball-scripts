This is a repository where I keep all of my baseball scripts that I have been working on as personal projects.

**Fangraphs Scraper** - Script that stores batter and pitcher data from 2010 -present. Every time I run it, I scrape the current seasons data and append it to a dataframe holding all years prior. This helps reduce run time so that I am only retrieving dynamic data, as opposed to static data from past years.

**MLB API* - Still working on.

**H.E.R & Q.A.B Report** - Hitter Efficiency Rating and Quality At Bat Report Generator. Given data, provides a report for each hitter and details how well their at bats went. This is done through the use of the R Shiny package. Details include calculations as well as strikezone plots of each pitch based on pitch type (fastball, offspeed, breaking) and result (out, rbi, runner moved, single, double, etc...).
